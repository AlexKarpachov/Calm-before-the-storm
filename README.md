# Calm Before the Storm

## Description
**Calm Before the Storm** is an atmospheric exploration game developed in 7 days as part of the **Brackeys Game Jam 2024**. The theme for the jam was *"Calm Before the Storm"*. In the game, the player explores a quiet island, gathers resources, and prepares for the incoming storm, which gradually transforms the world around them.

## Development Process

- I developed the entire game within the 7-day period, with the exception of the 3D models for objects in the world, which were created by a teammate. All other aspects of the game, including programming, animations, and game mechanics, were done by me.
- Team coordination was managed through **Discord** and **GitHub**.

## Key Learnings

During the development process, I gained valuable experience in character animation and controls. This included setting up the character's movement, animations, and interactions with the environment.

## Challenges

The game was not fully finished due to some unexpected challenges:
1. At the start, our team had two developers, but after three days, one team member left the project. I had to take over their responsibilities, which slowed down development.
2. Additionally, I had to handle the creation and setup of the UI, which was originally meant for another teammate. As a result, some elements were not polished or fully implemented by the deadline.

Despite these challenges, the core concept of the game is complete, and it offers a playable experience reflecting the jam's theme.
